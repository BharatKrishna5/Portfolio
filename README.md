# Portfolio
This is the repository I have used to create my portfolio website. The website consists of 4 clickable pages which are Home, Education, Projects and Find me.
Under Home I have given an image and a small description about myself and this webpage is the parent page of my website.
Under Education I have made use of the float and clear properties to format the webpage.
Under Projects I have made a small descriptive set of some projects I have been part of in various periods of my life.
Under Find me I have given links to some of my profiles and made use of an online stylesheet for adding icons.
I have also included a sidebar ( which warps to a header menu bar on smaller screens ) which includes the links to the above mentioned web pages.
I have included a footer at the bottom expressing my gratitude.
I have made use of various styling properties which I learnt through research in structuring my webpages notably media query for enabling a smooth viewing experience on smaller screens.
In conclusion this project has provided me with a learning experience that has contributed immensely to my web design journey.
