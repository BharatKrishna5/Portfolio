            <h1>Temperature Detector</h1>
            <div><p id="tempdet">This project presents a Temperature Detection System designed to monitor ambient temperature levels and alert users when a predefined threshold is exceeded. The system utilizes a temperature sensor to continuously measure real-time temperature. When the temperature rises above the set limit, a buzzer is activated to provide an immediate audible alert. This setup is ideal for environments where overheating may pose safety or equipment risks, such as in server rooms, greenhouses, or industrial machinery. The system is compact, efficient, and can be expanded to include visual indicators or connectivity features for remote monitoring.</p></div>

            <h1>Database Management System</h1>
            <p id="database">I had created a simple database management system in my twelfth grade using MySQL interfaced with python. The project comprised of different items you would usually find in a supermarket near you and each item was listed with a name, supplier, it's cost for the retailer, the price it's retailed for, the amount avaialable, the nature of the product and finally a discount if any. It's core was to provide retailers with a user friendly interface that they can use to manage their livelihood.</p>
